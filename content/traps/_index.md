Traps - Overview
</p>
<br>

<p class="fs-5">
Trapping refers confining a survivor within an area. <br><br>
Some set ups require confined space to fully trap a survivor. This section covers <strong> prepared set-ups</strong> that you can use in specific scenarios, not trapping in an impromptu manner in random areas which are harder.
<br><br>
Such forms of trapping are covered within a section of <a href="/tipsandtricks">Tips and Tricks.</a>

General Notes:
<ul class="fs-5">
<li class="my-2"> For traps that uses confined space, survivors with long stuns (ie. forward) can potentially cancel your confined space and vault back inside safety, though it rarely could happen. </li>

<li>For each map I have assigned a console a number (in a order that goes from left to right, top to bottom), you will see the reference when you click on one of the maps below.</li>
</ul>
