Traps - Overview
</p>
<br>

<p class="fs-5">
Trapping refers confining a survivor within an area. <br><br>
Some set ups require confined space to fully trap a survivor. This section covers <strong> prepared set-ups</strong> that you can use in specific scenarios, not trapping in an spontaneous manner in open areas which is harder.<br><br>
Such forms of trapping are covered within a section of <a href="/madeyesguide/tipsandtricks">Tips and Tricks.</a>

For each map I have assigned a console a number (in a order that goes from left to right, top to bottom), you will see the reference when you click on one of the maps below.
