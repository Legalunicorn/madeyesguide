My favourite map for trapping and also my favourite map in general. Do note that many examples here require confined space.

{{% trap 
title="1. Exiting from church back vault"
yturl="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4m_h54KUVxc?si=clp7rBYeFlX5CLSJ"
id="rc1"

keypoints=`
- Requires confined space, used when chasing
- Use console 2, pan downwards
- 40s walls `

addnotes=`
Due to the long panning distance of the console camera, you have to be quick! Open up your consoles **before they vault the window** or you won't make it in time.

Draw the wall as far away as possible from the vault to ensure survivors do not escape. becareful not to leave gaps at the sides

The survivor might vault back into church if you're not close enough to terror-shock them, which in that case you can usually still get a free hit as they run towards you. However if you're close enough, vaulting back will result in a terror shock so they often try to find gaps in your wall or vault it

This trap will be very useful to you as survivors like to use this vault a lot. It also can be part of a bigger trap to enclose the whole church as discussed later.

Usefulness: 5/5`%}}




{{%trap

You have to be close to the vault for this as experienced survivors can immediately vault out if they know its a trap. This one requires sufficient energy as the wall is quite long.


- Requires confined space, used when chasing
- console 4, drag 5
- 40s or 20s walls, depending if there is a undecoded cipher 
- Usefulness: 3/5`

addnotes=`
You may consider automatically doing trap #1 as well right after drawing this wall in anticipation of survivors vaulting back, though i have never tried it

If your church console energy is a little low, you can try doing my favourite "trap" instead which is to completely shut off the entire church exits which will be shown below (last trap discussed). It will take a little longer to get the down but there is no escape for the survivor.`%}}



{{%trap
title="3. Entering church side vault"

id="rc3"
keypoints=`
Open up your console just before they vault, or as they are vaulting.

- Requires confined space, used when chasing
- console 4, drag down-right 
- Usefulness: 4/5`
addnotes=`
You have to be extra quick for this one. if it fails consider closing all church exits (last trap discussed)`%}}


{{%trap
title="4. Above graveyard (1)"

id="rc4"
keypoints=`
Requires you to be fast. As a tip, remember you have to drag down the camera for this one, saves you time figuring out the orientation.

- Partially trap survivors
- No confined space, used
- console 5, drag down`
addnotes=`
watch out for the pallet, the worse think you can do is get stunned and waste a big opportunity. You may wall the pallet if necessary

This one only gives you one free hit, which is sitll good none the less.

Usefulness 3/5`

{{%trap
title="5. Above graveyard (2)"
yturl="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c7pctQWdR7U?si=lUomtGsjLFhn4B5Q"
id="rc5"
keypoints=`
- Fully trap survivors
- Confined space required
- console 5, drag down`
addnotes=`
It doesn't have to be coming from here, the survivor could be running from graveyard too.

You have to be quick! If done succesfully this trap is rewarding and it fully encloses a survivor

rating 4/5`

{{%trap
title="6. Left of red carpet"
yturl="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QXG009NwyZM?si=qds6B92IGeSV2FQ4"
id="rc6"
keypoints=`
- Fully trap survivors (40s walls)
- Console 7, drag right`
addnotes=`
This kind of narrow stretch is actually very similar to eversleeping town structure (between the buildings).

As a general tip, wall up the edge they are closer to and if they are in the middle, try to bait them to run to one edge first to put up your first wall. This so you have enough time to to put up the second wall.
 
While this trap is easy since there is no rush, the opportunity rarely comes along that they run across this stretch without thinking twice.

Usefulness: 3/5`
