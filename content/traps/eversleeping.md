Exploit the narrow spaces between building blocks that survivors use to transition kite.Most of these alleys can be trapped on both ends if you want to, or only on one end if you're chasing a half health survivor.<br><br>
A lot of these aren't technically traps but free hit is a free hit.Most of these are known by every player but i like to pretend im being helpful hah.

I know I said many stretches can be trapped on both end but this is an exception. not only is one enc close to a console but is it relatively short too thus you cant trap on both ends even if you wanted to.

Usefulness 3/5`
