A random collection of tips and tricks about anything, less the <a href="/madeyesguide/traps">traps</a> and <a href="/madeyesguide/camping">camping</a> that I've included in their own segment since they are big components.

{{<d d=5 str="Conserving energy for early game console spam">}}
<p class="fs-5">
The energy in the consoles at the start isn't much and s few bad walls will deplete it. 
<br><br>You might be tempted to immediately draw a wall upon seeing a running survivor when you check a console. Some high tiers do it, but I advice against doing so when the game just started.
<br><br>
This could very well work in lower tiers but it's not the same in high tier. Good survivors react fast and are good at juking walls. Depleting your consoles early lets them decode unharmed and undisrupted is not ideal.
<br><br>
What you should do to reduce energy wastage is to <strong>draw walls when they are not moving (hacking, decoding) or block of ciphers that are in corners.</strong> 
<br><br>You have a higher chance of chipping a survivor trying to hack since you can draw a wall super fast when you already anticipate their position (at the center of the screen). Same thing applies to ciphers that can be seen from the moment you view a console, you can anticipate where a decoding survivor will be before you view the console, making it easier to draw walls almost instantly. Survivors that are not moving and begin to move is also easier to hit than already running survivors
<br><br>
It is perfectly fine to visit a console, see a running survivor, switch consoles, then revisist the console again and repeat. This is especially so for consoles near ciphers. You may not be attacking them now but you make it very difficult for them to decode or hack your consoles with the constant checking
<br><br>
<strong>However, if you notice a survivor has late reactions, or generally bad at juking you can just go for the hit directly and it works pretty well.</strong>
<br><br>
Speaking off blocking ciphers, non-corner ciphers require two walls to block off. If the cipher can be seen upon viewing the console or you just have to drag a little, you dont have to spare at the screen doing nothing between drawing the first and second wall. Not only are you wasting energy by viewing the console, this few seconds can be used to scan other consoles. You can draw the first wall, harrass other survivors, then come back and draw the second wall when the cooldown is gone (~3 seconds).
