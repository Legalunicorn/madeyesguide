I won't touch this page for a while because I assume most players who come here know his basic abilities. Anyways some cools facts to know below.
</p>

{{<d d="5" str="1.Fat body rule">}}
<p class="fs-5 mb-5">
When madeyes vault a wall segement and doesn't move, a survivor cannot run through him even though the wall has gone down
</p>

{{<d d="5" str="2. Wall duratoin">}}
<p class="fs-5 mb-3">
By default his walls last 40s. Here are some exceptions: 
<Br><br>
- Near ciphers: 20s
<br>
- Near consoles: 10s
<br>
- Basement: 10s
<br>
- Near active chair: 5s
<br>
- Not allowed areas: 1s

<p class="fs-5">
If you're curious some areas including moonlit bridges only last 1s (for obvious reasons)
<br><br>
An important thing to note is that if both a cipher and console is near a wall, the duration of the wall is whichever it is closer to. This means that you can have a 20s wall near a console if its nearer to the cipher.
<br><br>
If you're super interested and want to plan and draw your traps on a map, the radius of "near" is 5m which is also 5 wall segments. You can use this information to design and determine traps that will actually work.
