Mad eyes has a great diversity in play styles, especially in the early game and usage of walls. I am not experienced in all of them but will attempt to introduce them to the best of my knowledge.
<p>
{{<d d="3" str="Early Game">}}

<p class="fs-5">
There are two main play styles, the <strong>console spammer</strong> and the <strong>chaser</strong> (and also a few hybrids in between). I will discuss them and give me recommendation.
</p>

{{<d d="5" str="The Console Spammer">}}
<p class="fs-5">
Goes immediately to the nearest console and quickly switch through the consoles. The goal is to either chip a survivor twice and then chase for one hit, or try to fully down a survivor by chipping/traps. Teleport and blink is the most common trait used.<br>
Example:
</p>

{{<d d="6" str="Pros">}}
<p class="fs-5">
You can slow down early game decoding while trying to chip survivors.<br><BR>Theoratically, you can half down a survivor while the rest has barely decoded because of your constant harrassment.<br><Br>This could potentially snowball into a very quick win if you down the injured survivor while there's still 5 ciphers remaining because of his camp.
</p>
{{<d d="6" str="Cons">}}
<p class="fs-5 my-3">
This is a risky play style that relies on survivors making mistakes. No matter how much of a “god” you are at consoles, you are left to the mercy of luck if the survivors are good. If you can’t damage anyone, you’re forced to chase for two hits. You end up wasting substantial time that can make the ciphers pop fast. <br><br>
For non-legendary rank match, if you spawn too far from a console, survivors can hack your consoles before you stop them, making this playstyle ineffective since the ciphers near hacked consoles will start popping pretty fast.

<div class="my-5"></div>
{{<d d="5" str="The Chaser">}}
<p class="fs-5">
The hunter goes straight for a chase after touching the consoles for a bit (or not). The strongest strategy I’ve observed in high tier is to instantly block some path or cage a nearby survivor to get a free hit. This method requires spawn select (legendary rank) to be consistent and is used with blink.<br>
Example:
</p>
{{<yt yturl="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJKRpmN2uYA?si=RkLX79f99B5GxQix">}}
<p class="fs-6">
Note that this is a very specific example and in some scenarios you chase without much help of any walls</p>

{{<d d="6" str="Pros">}}
<p class="fs-5">
This playstyle is harder to counter and you can usually secure a hit. If you fully trap survivors, you also have a good chance to completely down them at the start of the game</p>

{{<d d="6" str="Cons">}}
<p class="fs-5">
Unfortunately you can only use powerful cages in certain spawns/scenarios. If you are a chaser player that don't get the right spawns, youll end up with a rough early game.
<br><br>
Additionally, every survivor can be trapped as well, survivors which can fly or tank a hit will usally be harder to down
<br><br>
There is also some risk involved. Sometimes you make mistakes or their spawns allow them to escape quick. This forces you to chase because your other consoles will be hacked by the other survivors by then.</p>

<div class="my-5"></div>
{{<d d="5" str="What to Pick?">}}
<p class="fs-5">
For the longest time I only used console spammer style. However it is difficult to chip good survivors because their reflexes are almost instant and they know how to juke your walls.
<br><br>
As much as I can, I use the cage + chase strategy unless I get an unfavourable spawn, in which I default back to the console spammer playstyle.
<br><br>
If you dont have spawn select I recommand to console spam, but control yourself. If you can't get 2 chips on a survivor or trap them after a minute or so, its a good idea to forget about it and go for a chase.
<Br><Br>
In conclusion, being able to use both will  maximise your winning chances, and I think you should get comfortable with both.
